This project consists of 2 android applications which use a Google App Engine backend (GAE). These prototype applications 
for developed as part of a Masters Thesis (MSc Software Development).
One application will write prescription information to an NFC tag. This tag is then attached to the medication.

A user can then use the prescription tracker application to simply swipe the NFC tag attached to the medication. This uses text-to-speech
to provide information on the medication (how many times to take etc). The user can swipe the NFC tag to record that they have taken their medication. This application is a simple way to track medication adherence.

The application was written in 2013 so the GAE API's may be out of date.

A video example of the application is here:

Apologies for the quality! It was recorded after a long night coding this application for a Masters thesis.
